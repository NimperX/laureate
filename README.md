## Project Structure

It is a single page app and the entry point is `pages/index.tsx`. In `pages/index.tsx` you'll find that the layout of the app is broken into 4 major components:

1. Header
2. SidePanel
3. TweetCard
4. ExportButton

All these components are located in the `components` folder. Each of those components except `ExportButton` are broken into sub-components in their respective folders.
